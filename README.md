# Tehelee's Baseline

  This package provides a lightweight networked gameplay baseline based on the LLAPI of Unity Transport.
  It relies on class-based packet definitions and server-authoritative gameplay.

  Additionally there are included utilities for runtime and editor usage, as well as quality-of-life runtime components.
